        "Title": "Douglas Engelbart",
        "Synopsis": "The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was done by Doug Engelbart in the Mother of All Demos.[1] Mice originally used two separate wheels to directly track movement across a surface: one in the X-dimension and one in the Y. Later, the standard design shifted to use a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion, in turn connected to internal rollers. Most modern mice use optical movement detection with no moving parts. Though originally all mice were connected to a computer by a cable, many modern mice are cordless, relying on short-range radio communication with the connected system.",
